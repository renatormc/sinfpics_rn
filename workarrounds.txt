For now, as a workaround, search which file uses the deprecated currentlyFocusedField() that causes the error and try changing it to currentlyFocusedInput(). In my case, changing them in the following file did the trick:
node_modules/@react-navigation/native/lib/module/createKeyboardAwareNavigator.js
